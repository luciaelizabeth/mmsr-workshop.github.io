# Submissions

We solicit papers on multimodal semantic representation, including but not limited to the following topics:
* Examination and interpretation of co-gestural speech and co-speech gesture;
* Semantic frameworks for individual linguistic co-modalities (e.g. gaze, facial expression);
* Formal representation of situated conversation and embodiment;
* Design and annotation of multimodal meaning representation (including extensions of existing semantic frameworks);
* Challenges in cross-lingual or cross-cultural multimodal representation;
* Challenges in semantic parsing of multimodal representation;
* Challenges in aligning co-modalities in formal representation and/or NLP;
* Discussion of criteria for evaluation of multimodal semantics;
* Position papers on meaning, language, and multimodality;
* Simulated agents that embody multimodal representations of common ground.

Two types of submission are solicited: long papers (8 pages, excluding references and acknowledgments) and short papers (4 pages, excluding references and acknowledgments).  Accepted papers will be published in the ACL anthology.  Authors will receive up to an extra page to address reviewer comments for the camera-ready version.  Submissions should use the [IWCS 2021 stylesheet](https://iwcs2021.github.io/download/iwcs2021-templates.zip) and should be **fully anonymized** for double-blind reviewing.

Like IWCS 2021, MMSR does not have a pre-submission anonymity period, but we ask authors not to publicly advertise any preprints of submitted work during (or right before) the review period.

We strongly encourage students to submit to the workshop and will consider a student session depending on the number of submissions.

We will be using SoftConf to handle submissions.  Please submit your papers [here](https://www.softconf.com/iwcs2021/MMSR1/)!
